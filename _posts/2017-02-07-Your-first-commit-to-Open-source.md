Open source works by having many people contribute to the creation and maintenance of software. Thing is, it works well only when people are actually contributing. For many programmers, though, the thought of contributing to open source projects seems too difficult and time-consuming. They think that you have to be a programming genius blessed with unlimited free time to make a meaningful contribution. That’s simply not true. Successful open source projects thrive on a wide variety of contributions from people with all levels of coding skills and commitment. If just one person fixes a compiler warning, closes a bug, or adds to the documentation, pretty soon you’re talking real progress. For many people, the hardest part is just getting started. So this article would help you get started with contributing to Open Source.

## FLOSS - Free, libre, open source software

Free software is a philosophical concept that aims to convey the idea of software that can be used, studied and modified without any restriction. It does not refer to price, but liberty. This software can be freely distributed. Because many people can confuse the concept of free software with freeware (closed-source software freely distributed by the author) the concept of Libre Software was created. Libre is a word used by several Romanic Languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and French. This word does not exist in English, but what it means is free as in "free speech", freedom as a right that a citizen has and not freedom associated with zero cost (Gratis). Open source on the other hand is a movement which emphasizes on source code of software being freely available. It also talks about certain criteria which must exist in the license of software to make it open source.

I will provide few super simple steps which would help you to get started. Let’s do it. 


## Report a bug

Bug/issue management is one of the least sexy ways to contribute to an open source project, but it’s also one of the most important.
When you find a bug in an open source package you use, report it into the project’s bug tracking system. This is probably the single most useful thing you can do to contribute to a project, because if users don’t report bugs, chances are that the developers won’t find about them. If the developers knew about the bugs, they would have fixed them, right? If you really want to help, take the time to do a good solid write-up into the project’s bug tracking system. 

## Verify and track down a reported bug

You can also go through the bug tracking system and help improve existing trouble tickets. Find a bug and see if you can reproduce it on your system. This can be invaluable to the developers trying to narrow down the cause of a problem.

## Write an example for the documentation

Few developers are eager to write documentation, but it’s critical to the success of open source projects. What’s the first thing you look for when exploring a new project? The documentation. And what’s the first thing you look for in that documentation? Examples of how to use it.
It’s easy to come up with examples for the documentation if you’ve been using the software for a while. For projects related to programming, such as a library or a framework, create a simple example that shows a common use case of the code. In many cases, you can take working code of your own, extract the most interesting parts, and you have a real-world example to help new users understand quickly.
For applications, a few screenshots of common usage of the tool will go a long way to help new users.

## Edit the project wiki

Wikis are becoming more and more prevalent as an easy way for people to contribute to project documentation. For some projects, like the Solr search engine, the project doesn’t have standalone documentation, leaving the wiki as the primary source of documentation.
The beauty of wikis is that there’s no minimum barrier to entry, so it’s easy to make contributions with a minimum of fuss. Adding a sentence here, a paragraph there takes only minutes but becomes part of the project forever, helping untold numbers of users down the line.


## Answer a question

Time spent helping others is an investment in the project as much as writing code. The more qualified users of the software that join in helps grow the project as a whole. If you’re at all experienced with a given piece of open source software, you’re probably able to help people who are newer to it than you are. Try to lend a hand to others who are struggling.

A great place to start is StackOverflow, which has become the preeminent Q&A site for programmers helping other programmers. If your expertise runs more toward server administration, SO’s sister site ServerFault is a great place to help contribute your knowledge.
Of course, many projects have their own dedicated forums and mailing lists devoted. Sign up for one and see how you can help. Remember, the newbie you help today may someday contribute great new features.


## Find the right project to contribute to

Finally, a quick note on a common question: “I want to get started in open source, but what project should I work on?”
The best project to contribute to is one that you actively use. Don’t worry about which project needs you the most. All open source projects need help. A project you already use is going to give you the most motivation and you won’t have a learning curve trying to figure it out. If you choose a project that you use at work, like a web framework, for example, you may get time to work on it at work, and you’ll make your work life easier as well.
Whether you’re working to improve the code of the project itself, or just help spread knowledge and attract users, it’s surprisingly easy to get started contributing to open source projects. Just take a few small steps to dip your toe in the water, and pretty soon helping the open source community will become an everyday part of your life as a software developer. And open source software will be the better for your contributions.


## Career opportunities

We don't want to undermine one’s intelligence by making you believe that the number of jobs in OSS (open source software) is much higher than that for proprietary software. However; though smaller, it is a niche market. Today it would be easier to get a C/C++ programmer job. In order to get developers who have programmed in newer technologies like Python, or Ruby, and who have understood the community, its trends, and its ways of working would certainly take a lot more time and effort. Just as we make correct technology choices for a software solution based on its architecture, organizations need to make choices to find the right fit for the right job. With the growing trends of involvement and usage of OSS in companies the demand for open source developers to take up this work is definitely on the rise. In summary, OSS jobs are increasing. It’s still a niche area, but its growth potential makes it worth exploring. Needless to say that being an expert in a niche area always calls for a premium salary for oneself.

## opportunities for students

There are organizations such as Google, Mozilla, Gnome foundation, Redhat and open stack which provides paid internships for open contributions through programs like GSoC(Google Summer of Code), Outreachy program which pays a stipend of 5500 USD.  Added to these for ages 13-17 they have an event called Google Code In too. 

## Knowledge on version control systems like git

This is very important to gain knowledge on how the projects are managed on repositories. 
•	How to create a pull request?
•	What is a branch? 
•	To which branch should I must point to?
•	How to handle merge conflicts? 
•	Issue assignment and feature add ons
•	How to install the project locally (various Git commands for forking, cloning etc) 
•	How to hot your own repository on various Git repository hosting services like Github, Bitbucket etc. 
•	Various stages in product management. 


That's all folks, hope this blog post helps you to get started initially.
